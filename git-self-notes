1. git init vs git clone
- git init creates a empty .git folder in order to act working directory as a git repository
- git clone - clones the code and already made .git repository in local
2. fork vs clone
- forking a repository from repo A creates a different .git file than repo B in which it is forked . Both will have different .git states.
If we want add our work on top of someone else's repo , we should go for fork. in this way scope increases. 
- Cloning a repository means .git state will be same in both the repos. any changes made will be reflected back and forth.
